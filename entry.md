-A `Gear Ratio` is defined as the ratio of the rotational speeds of the first and final gears in a train of gears or of any two meshing gears. Essentially, the ratio of the input speed to the output speed of a geared set of shafts. These can be decided to choose a ratio of **Speed** (large gear driving small gear) or **** [**Torque**](torque.md) **** (small gear driving large gear).

These can be decided to choose a ratio of **Speed** (large gear driving small gear) or [**Torque**](torque.md) (small gear driving large gear).
 
 Gear ratios are often simplified fractions of the number of teeth on each gear. This is because (at least in Vex) gears have a proportional number of teeth to their diameter which defines the difference in output speed. From the above image, there is a 12 tooth gear, driving a 36 tooth gear which would constitute a 3:1 ratio.&#x20;

-**Traction wheels**, mostly only referred to plainly as "wheels" by VEX, **** are the simplest wheel type offered in the VEX Robotics Competition, only having one degree of freedom (forward and backward). They are made up of two simple parts: an acetal frame and a tire that fits around said frame, typically made of rubber or a material similar to rubber. They are typically used in the center of drivetrains to restrict unwanted sideways movement (such as from defense).

 # C-Channels and Angles
 
-The most commonly used type of metal in VEX, C-Channels provide a stable, secure grounding for a majority of subsystems that can be used. The “C” shape contains two corners, which give the C-Channel a strong, sturdy form, making it ideal for structural use and bracing. **** There are three variations of C-Channel, in terms of their width:
